# quotesforamocrm

Auto-replace the quotation mark in the names of contacts and companies with the Christmas tree symbol.
Why: when solving problems, we were faced with the fact that when using ordinary quotation marks it is impossible to find a specific contact that contains quotation marks, by searching with the help of the Christmas tree I solved this problem, but when I inserted this element I had to go to tricks, for example, I I use Word for this.
If you need group replacement of quotes in already created contacts, click on the “Lists” tab, check the necessary contacts and select the action of the “AisA-Auto-replace quotes” plugin. There are problems with the plugin working at certain positions, the plugin may not work in some fields, but you you can save the contact and then on the “Lists” tab correct them through a checkmark and batch processing.
